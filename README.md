# Games

You can try the mini-games I wrote to please my kids. They are unfinished at all so don't judge my skills from them!

## Happy Mrs Chicken

I tried to mimic the game as shown in [this Peppa pig episode](https://youtu.be/nOnXoVcFtGg?t=213). This game does nothing but lay eggs by pressing <kbd>space</kbd>.

# Happy typing

I once chatted with my wife about how a typing game should be designed. I said to get children to type in the right way, the typing game should start with the letters <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>f</kbd> to fix their index finger to the right place first. Then I went ahead and made two stages.
